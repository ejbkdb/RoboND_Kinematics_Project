Theta1, can be found by using the projection of the wrist center onto the XY plane.

theta1 = atan2(Yc,Xc)
  Xc = X component of wrist center position
  Yc = Y component of wrist center position

b = sqrt(d^2+e^2 - 2*d*e*cos(B))
  b = straight line distance between joint 3 and 5
  d = distance between joint 2 and 5
  e = link length from joint 4 and 5
  B = angle between d and e

angle(a) = acos((b^2+c^2-a^2)/(2*b*c))
angle(b) = acos((a^2+c^2-b^2)/(2*a*c))
angle(c) = acos((a^2+b^2-c^2)/(2*a*b))

Theta2 =(pi/2) - angle(a) - atan2(g,f)
 g = (J5z-J2z) distance between the Z position of joint 5 and the Z position of joint 2
 f = sqrt((J5x-J2x)^2-(J5y-J2y)^2) projection of c onto XY plane

Theta3 = (pi/2)-angle(b) - asin(a/b)
  a = link length from joint 2 to 3
  b = straight distance from joint 3 to 5

 The rotation matrix from the base to the 3rd link can then be calculated by extracting the rotation
 matrix from each respective tranformation matrix for each joint and multiplying them together, substrituting
 in for Theta1,Theta2, and Theta3.
